# DeepLearningwKeras
The examples are taken from [Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with Python"](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks) with an updated and now working syntax for [KERAS](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
